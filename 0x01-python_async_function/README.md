# Async Basics

This project demonstrates the basics of asynchronous programming in Python using the `asyncio` library. The main functionality is provided by an asynchronous coroutine `wait_random` which waits for a random delay and then returns it.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7
- Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
- `pycodestyle` (version 2.5.x)

## Usage

To use the `wait_random` coroutine, import it into your Python script and run it using `asyncio.run()` or within an event loop.
